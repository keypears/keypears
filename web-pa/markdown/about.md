# About PassApples

**A KeyPears-compatible node based in London, England**

PassApples is the first alternate node in the KeyPears network, providing a fully compatible password management service with European data residency. Running on AWS infrastructure in London (EU-West-2), PassApples offers the same security guarantees as keypears.com while giving users the option of European data storage.

## What is the KeyPears Network?

KeyPears is a decentralized Diffie-Hellman key exchange platform that enables secure communication between any two email addresses (e.g., `alice@passapples.com` ↔ `bob@keypears.com`). Built on this foundation, it serves as both a password manager and cryptocurrency wallet that puts you in complete control while making it easy to sync across devices and share with others.

## Why PassApples?

PassApples provides:

- **European Data Residency** - Your encrypted vault data is stored in the London AWS region
- **Full Interoperability** - Exchange keys and messages with users on keypears.com or any KeyPears-compatible node
- **Same Security** - Identical cryptographic protocols and key derivation functions as KeyPears
- **Open Source** - Running the same Apache 2.0 licensed codebase

## The Federated Approach

Unlike traditional password managers, the KeyPears protocol uses an email-like architecture. You can:

- Establish secure communication channels with any email address across any domain
- Choose which node best fits your needs (geographic location, provider preference)
- Run your own KeyPears node for complete self-custody
- Share secrets securely with end-to-end encryption via DH key exchange

## About Identellica

PassApples is owned and operated by [Identellica LLC](https://identellica.com), the same company that operates keypears.com. Identellica is a pseudonymous identity verification service committed to giving users control over their digital identity and secrets.
