# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 23, 2025

PassApples is developed and operated by Identellica LLC. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have control over your data.

## Data Collection

PassApples is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local-First**: Your secrets are stored locally on your devices in encrypted form
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All secrets are encrypted with keys only you control
- **Optional Sync**: Synchronization with servers is entirely optional and opt-in
- **No Analytics**: We do not collect analytics, tracking data, or telemetry from the KeyPears applications

## Server Data

If you choose to use our synchronization service at passapples.com:

- **Encrypted Data Only**: We only store encrypted diffs and metadata. We cannot decrypt your secrets
- **No Content Access**: Your master keys never leave your devices
- **Account Information**: We store your email address and authentication credentials
- **No Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties
- **European Data Residency**: All data is stored in AWS EU-West-2 (London)

## Self-Hosting

You can run your own KeyPears-compatible node to maintain complete control over where your encrypted data is stored. Instructions for self-hosting are available in the KeyPears documentation.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your account and all associated encrypted data at any time. For data deletion requests, please contact us at privacy@passapples.com.

## Open Source

PassApples runs on the KeyPears open source software licensed under Apache 2.0. You can review the code, cryptography, and security practices at any time.
