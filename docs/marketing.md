# KeyPears Marketing Plan

## 🎯 1. Define Core Positioning

**Decentralized Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange System**

**Message:**\
"KeyPears is the first federated, open-source, end-to-end encrypted
**Diffie-Hellman key exchange platform** enabling secure communication between
any two email addresses (`alice@example.com` ↔ `bob@example2.com`). Built on
this foundation: password management, cryptocurrency wallets, and secure secret
sharing across domains."

**Differentiator vs incumbents:**

- **Decentralized DH key exchange:** Email-based addresses that enable secure
  key exchange across any provider without central coordination.
- **Dual-purpose platform:** Both password manager AND cryptocurrency wallet
  built on the same DH exchange foundation.
- **Federation:** Email-like addresses (`alice@domain`) that work across
  providers.
- **Open-source transparency:** Licensed under Apache 2.0, community-driven.
- **Crypto-native:** DH key exchange enables both secret sharing _and_ crypto
  wallet functionality.
- **Dual monetization:** Ads (metadata-driven) for free tier, subscriptions to
  remove ads.

👉 **Summary:**\
KeyPears goes **crypto-first**, positioning as a "**Decentralized Diffie-Hellman
Key Exchange System**" — the first platform enabling secure key exchange between
any email addresses.\
Text-only marketing (Reddit, Twitter, blogs, forums) amplifies reach with
minimal overhead.\
Revenue comes from ads + premium subs in the near term, licensing and enterprise
later.\
If the decentralized DH key exchange angle takes off, KeyPears can grow from an
OSS project to a **category-defining platform** unifying password management,
cryptocurrency wallets, and secure communication.
