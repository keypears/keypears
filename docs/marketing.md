# KeyPears Marketing Plan

## 🎯 1. Define Core Positioning

**Message:**\
“KeyPears is the first federated, open-source, end-to-end encrypted platform for
sharing passwords, API keys, and **cryptocurrency payments** across domains.”

**Differentiator vs incumbents:**

- **Federation:** Email-like addresses (`alice@domain`) that work across
  providers.
- **Open-source transparency:** Licensed under Apache 2.0, community-driven.
- **Crypto-first:** Send secrets _and_ crypto transactions like email.
- **Dual monetization:** Ads (metadata-driven) for free tier, subscriptions to
  remove ads.
