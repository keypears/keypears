# KeyPears Business Plan

## Executive Summary

KeyPears is the first **federated, end-to-end encrypted key & secret sharing
platform**, designed to become the "email for secrets." It enables secure,
cross-domain sharing of passwords, API tokens, crypto keys, and cryptocurrency
transactions. Unlike traditional password managers locked into a single
provider, KeyPears is **open source, federated, and privacy-first**. The code is
licensed under **Apache 2.0**, while the **KeyPears** brand is owned by
**Identellica LLC**.

KeyPears’ unique model combines:

- **Free with ads**: Metadata-driven targeted ads, a new category of
  monetization in password managers.
- **Premium subscriptions**: $3–5/month per user to remove ads, unlock more
  storage, and gain priority features.
- **Open-source federation**: Anyone can self-host, but the brand “KeyPears”
  requires licensing for businesses.
- **Crypto integration**: Sending crypto like email (alice@domain → bob@domain),
  starting with Ethereum L2 + USDC for stability, with Solana and Bitcoin to
  follow.

Marketing will be **100% text-based**, focusing on developer and crypto
communities: Reddit, X/Twitter, blogs, newsletters, and forums.

## Business Model

1. **Ads (Free Tier)**

   - Users on keypears.com see ads tied to non-private metadata (e.g. “you have
     a Coinbase account → crypto service ads”).
   - Realistic CPM for targeted crypto/tech ads: $5–15.
   - At 100k free users, with 20% ad engagement, potential **$10k–20k/month** ad
     revenue.

2. **Premium Subscriptions**

   - $3–5/month to remove ads.
   - 3–5% conversion from free → premium.
   - At 100k users, 5% premium = 5k paying = **$15k–25k/month**.

3. **Brand Licensing**

   - Businesses adopting the protocol under “KeyPears” brand pay licensing.
     (Est. $50–200 per small business client/month in later years.)

4. **Enterprise & Consulting (Later)**

   - Federated enterprise deployments with compliance features.

## Marketing Strategy (Text-Only)

### Channels

- **Reddit** — /r/crypto, /r/defi, /r/selfhosted, /r/privacy, /r/programming.
- **X/Twitter** — Crypto Twitter for fast amplification.
- **Blogs** — Thought-leadership posts: _“Email for crypto payments,”_ _“Why
  password managers need federation.”_
- **Newsletters & Forums** — Partner with crypto/OSS newsletters and developer
  communities.

### Style

- **Purely text-based** marketing, leaning into controversy (“ad-supported
  password manager,” “send ETH like email”).
- **Hooks**: short, viral one-liners — “Your new email is also your wallet,”
  “Ads or privacy: you choose.”

### Expected Eyeballs

- Initial Reddit/HN launch: 50k–100k views.
- With consistent posting + crypto buzz: 200k–500k monthly impressions by
  year 1.
- Viral crypto posts (esp. with payments): 1M+ impressions possible.
