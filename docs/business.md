# KeyPears Business Plan

## Executive Summary

**Decentralized Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange System**

KeyPears is the first **federated, end-to-end encrypted Diffie-Hellman key
exchange platform**, enabling secure communication between any two email
addresses (e.g., `alice@example.com` ↔ `bob@example2.com`). Built on this DH
exchange foundation, it unifies password management, cryptocurrency wallets, and
secure secret sharing across domains. Unlike traditional systems locked into a
single provider, KeyPears is **open source, federated, and privacy-first**. The
code is licensed under **Apache 2.0**, while the **KeyPears** brand is owned by
**Identellica LLC**.

KeyPears' unique model combines:

- **Decentralized DH key exchange**: Core differentiator enabling secure
  email-to-email key exchange across any domain.
- **Dual-purpose platform**: Both password manager AND cryptocurrency wallet
  built on the same DH foundation.
- **Free with ads**: Metadata-driven targeted ads, a new category of
  monetization.
- **Premium subscriptions**: $3–5/month per user to remove ads, unlock more
  storage, and gain priority features.
- **Open-source federation**: Anyone can self-host, but the brand "KeyPears"
  requires licensing for businesses.
- **Crypto wallet integration**: Email addresses as wallet identities
  (alice@domain ↔ bob@domain), starting with Ethereum L2 + USDC for stability,
  with Solana and Bitcoin to follow.

Marketing will be **100% text-based**, focusing on developer and crypto
communities: Reddit, X/Twitter, blogs, newsletters, and forums.

## Business Model

1. **Ads (Free Tier)**

   - Users on keypears.com see ads tied to non-private metadata (e.g. “you have
     a Coinbase account → crypto service ads”).
   - Realistic CPM for targeted crypto/tech ads: $5–15.
   - At 100k free users, with 20% ad engagement, potential **$10k–20k/month** ad
     revenue.

2. **Premium Subscriptions**

   - $3–5/month to remove ads.
   - 3–5% conversion from free → premium.
   - At 100k users, 5% premium = 5k paying = **$15k–25k/month**.

3. **Brand Licensing**

   - Businesses adopting the protocol under “KeyPears” brand pay licensing.
     (Est. $50–200 per small business client/month in later years.)

4. **Enterprise & Consulting (Later)**

   - Federated enterprise deployments with compliance features.

## Marketing Strategy (Text-Only)

### Channels

- **Reddit** — /r/crypto, /r/defi, /r/selfhosted, /r/privacy, /r/programming.
- **X/Twitter** — Crypto Twitter for fast amplification.
- **Blogs** — Thought-leadership posts: _“Email for crypto payments,”_ _“Why
  password managers need federation.”_
- **Newsletters & Forums** — Partner with crypto/OSS newsletters and developer
  communities.

### Style

- **Purely text-based** marketing, leaning into technical differentiation
  ("Decentralized DH key exchange," "Email addresses as wallet identities").
- **Hooks**: short, viral one-liners — "Decentralized Diffie-Hellman for email
  addresses," "Your email is your wallet," "Ads or privacy: you choose."

### Expected Eyeballs

- Initial Reddit/HN launch: 50k–100k views.
- With consistent posting + crypto buzz: 200k–500k monthly impressions by
  year 1.
