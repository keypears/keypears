# Documentation site at docs.keypears.com

## Goal

Create a documentation site at `docs.keypears.com` (locally
`docs.keypears.test`) for detailed protocol documentation, server administration
guides, and API reference. The whitepaper provides an 8-page overview; the docs
site provides everything needed to understand, implement, and operate KeyPears.

## Background

The whitepaper at `keypears.com/keypears.pdf` is an architectural overview aimed
at developers and security researchers evaluating the system. It is deliberately
concise. Detailed documentation — how to run a server, how federation works step
by step, the full API surface, key derivation internals — needs a dedicated
site.

### Hosting

The docs site will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages at `docs.keypears.com`. Locally
it runs at `docs.keypears.test` via the existing Caddy + dnsmasq dev setup.
Documentation deploys are independent from app deploys.

### Framework

Astro with Starlight (Astro's official docs theme). Starlight provides:

- Markdown/MDX pages with automatic sidebar navigation from file structure
- Built-in search, dark mode, mobile-responsive layout
- Ability to drop into HTML/Astro components via MDX when needed
- Static output suitable for Cloudflare Pages

### Content sources

Existing documentation that should be migrated or adapted:

- `docs/kdf.md` — key derivation system (detailed)
- `docs/federation.md` — federation model, pull delivery, PoW (detailed)
- `docs/dev-setup.md` — local HTTPS via Caddy + dnsmasq
- `CLAUDE.md` — project structure, tech stack, conventions (partial)
- `whitepaper/keypears.typ` — protocol overview (reference, not copied)

### Planned sections

1. **Getting Started** — What is KeyPears, create an account, send a message
2. **Self-Hosting** — Run your own server, environment variables, database
   setup, Caddy configuration
3. **Federation** — How domains discover each other, `keypears.json`, deployment
   patterns, pull-model delivery, domain claiming
4. **Protocol** — Address format, key derivation, encryption (ECDH + ACB3),
   proof of work, session management
5. **API Reference** — oRPC procedures (server-to-server and client-to-server)
6. **Security** — Threat model, key management, password change, limitations

### Project structure

```
docs/                     # Astro + Starlight project (replaces old docs/)
  src/
    content/
      docs/
        getting-started.md
        self-hosting.md
        federation.md
        protocol/
          addressing.md
          key-derivation.md
          encryption.md
          proof-of-work.md
          sessions.md
        api-reference.md
        security.md
  astro.config.mjs
  package.json
```

The `docs/` directory becomes the Astro project, replacing the current loose
markdown files. The existing content in `docs/kdf.md`, `docs/federation.md`, and
`docs/dev-setup.md` will be migrated into the Starlight content structure under
`docs/src/content/docs/`. This is similar to how `passapples/` and
`lockberries/` are standalone Astro projects.

## Experiment 1: Scaffold the docs site with initial content

### Hypothesis

A first-pass documentation site can be created by scaffolding an Astro +
Starlight project in `docs/`, customizing it to match the KeyPears brand, and
migrating the existing markdown docs into the Starlight content structure.

### Design

**Visual identity.** The docs site matches the KeyPears webapp brand:

- Tokyo Night base theme (light: `#e1e2e7` bg, dark: `#151a16` bg)
- Sage green accent (`hsl(109 58% 40%)` light, `hsl(115 54% 76%)` dark)
- Green-tinted neutrals for text and borders (not pure gray)
- Dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Font: Inter (same as webapp) or system sans-serif

Starlight supports custom CSS overrides for colors. The accent color and
background can be set via Starlight's color configuration or a custom CSS file
that maps to the KeyPears palette.

**Initial content.** Migrate and adapt existing docs:

1. **Welcome / Introduction** — Brief overview linking to the whitepaper. What
   KeyPears is, who it's for, how to get started.

2. **Protocol: Addressing** — Address format (`name@domain`), email
   compatibility, domain ownership = identity ownership.

3. **Protocol: Key Derivation** — Adapted from `docs/kdf.md`. Three-tier BLAKE3
   PBKDF, encryption key caching, per-key password tracking.

4. **Protocol: Encryption** — ECDH + ACB3 message encryption, vault encryption,
   vault key derivation.

5. **Protocol: Proof of Work** — pow5-64b algorithm, interactive challenges,
   configurable difficulty, authenticated challenges, replay prevention.

6. **Federation** — Adapted from `docs/federation.md`. Discovery via
   `keypears.json`, three deployment patterns, pull-model delivery.

7. **Self-Hosting** — Adapted from `docs/dev-setup.md`. Environment variables,
   database setup, Caddy reverse proxy, domain configuration.

8. **Security** — Threat model from the whitepaper expanded: server compromise,
   brute-force, spam, social-graph probing, domain spoofing, client storage
   theft, limitations.

**Dev server.** Add a `dev:docs` script to the root `package.json` and configure
Caddy to serve `docs.keypears.test` on a new port. Add the port to the
concurrently `dev` script.

### Changes

1. Move existing `docs/*.md` files to a temporary location or directly into
   `docs/src/content/docs/`.
2. Scaffold the Astro + Starlight project in `docs/`.
3. Customize Starlight theme colors to match KeyPears brand.
4. Create initial content pages from the list above.
5. Add `docs` to the bun workspace in root `package.json`.
6. Add dev server configuration (port, Caddy, concurrently).
7. Verify the site builds and runs locally at `docs.keypears.test`.

### Pass criteria

- `docs/` is a working Astro + Starlight project.
- Site builds and runs at `docs.keypears.test`.
- Brand colors match the KeyPears webapp (sage green accent, Tokyo Night base).
- At least the welcome page and one protocol page render correctly.
- Existing doc content is preserved (migrated into Starlight structure).

### Result: Pass

Astro + Starlight project scaffolded in `docs/` with 8 content pages, KeyPears
brand colors, logo in navbar, astrohacker footer, and dev server on port 3530.
Site builds (9 pages) and runs locally. However, some content from the old docs
was not fully migrated — addressed in Experiment 2.

---

## Experiment 2: Migrate all remaining content from old docs

### Hypothesis

The old `docs/` directory contained three detailed documents (`kdf.md`,
`federation.md`, `dev-setup.md`) with information that was only partially
migrated into the new Starlight docs. All information must be preserved — the
docs site covers everything, not just the protocol.

### Missing content

Comparing the old docs against the new, the following information is missing:

**From `kdf.md`:**
- Implementation section — function names and file paths (`derivePasswordKey`,
  `deriveEncryptionKeyFromPasswordKey`, etc. in `webapp/src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Key rotation mechanics — how new key pairs are generated, encrypted, and
  stored; how `loginKeyHash` tracks which password encrypted which key

**From `federation.md`:**
- `keypears.json` caching — TTL recommendation (1 hour suggested)
- Key discovery — how to look up a user's public key via `getPublicKey`
- Same-domain delivery — the simpler path when sender and recipient share a
  server
- Message structure — the fields table (`senderAddress`, `encryptedContent`,
  `senderPubKey`, `recipientPubKey`, `isRead`)
- Message size limit — 50,000 hex chars (~25KB plaintext)
- Server configuration — env vars table (`KEYPEARS_DOMAIN`,
  `KEYPEARS_API_DOMAIN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `KEYPEARS_SECRET`)

**From `dev-setup.md`:**
- The entire document — Caddy + dnsmasq local HTTPS setup, `.test` domain
  configuration, dev topology table, daily workflow

### Changes

1. **`protocol/key-derivation.md`** — Add "Implementation" section with
   function names and file paths. Add "Key rotation" section.

2. **`federation.md`** — Add caching, key discovery, same-domain delivery,
   message structure table, and message size limit sections.

3. **`self-hosting.md`** — Ensure server configuration env vars table is
   complete (already partially there).

4. **New page: `development.md`** — Local development setup adapted from
   `dev-setup.md`. Caddy + dnsmasq setup, dev topology, daily workflow. Add
   to sidebar.

### Pass criteria

- Every piece of information from the three old docs exists somewhere in the
  new docs site.
- New development page covers local HTTPS setup.
- Site builds successfully.
