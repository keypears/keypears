# Issue 2: Security Audit

## Goal

Audit and fix all security gaps in KeyPears: session cookies, password hashing,
message authentication, and sender verification. Every message received must be
cryptographically verified as coming from the claimed sender.

## Background

KeyPears is an end-to-end encrypted messaging system using secp256k1 key pairs,
ECDH shared secrets, and ACS2 encryption. A security audit revealed several
issues ranging from critical (no sender public key verification) to moderate
(raw user ID as session cookie).

### Audit findings

#### 1. Session cookies

The session cookie stores a **raw UUIDv7 user ID** as its value. Cookie flags
are reasonable (`httpOnly`, `sameSite: "lax"`, `secure` in production), and
expiration is 1 day for unsaved accounts, 2 years for saved ones. However:

- UUIDv7 is sequential — if the ID format is known, cookies are guessable.
- No session token layer exists. A leaked user ID = full impersonation.
- No session revocation mechanism (can't invalidate sessions without changing
  the user's database ID).
- No session rotation on sensitive actions (password change, key rotation).

#### 2. Password hashing / KDF — GOOD

The three-tier BLAKE3-based KDF is sound:

```
Password (never stored)
  -> [100k blake3Pbkdf rounds, password-derived salt]
  -> Password Key (ephemeral, discarded)
    -> [100k rounds, "encryption salt v1"] -> Encryption Key (localStorage, NEVER sent to server)
    -> [100k rounds, "login salt v1"]      -> Login Key (sent to server once, discarded)
      -> [100k rounds server-side, "server login salt v1"] -> Stored hash
```

- Encryption key and login key are siblings — neither derivable from the other.
- Server hashes login key with 100k additional rounds before storing.
- Timing-safe comparison on verification.
- Total rounds to crack: 400k BLAKE3 iterations per guess.

No issues found. This is well-designed.

#### 3. Sender public key verification — CRITICAL

The `sendMessage` handler accepts `senderPubKey` and `recipientPubKey` directly
from the client without verifying they match the actual keys in the database.
The server already has this data (via `getActiveKey`) but doesn't check it.

For local delivery: a logged-in user could send messages with a bogus public
key. The `senderAddress` is correctly forced from the session, but the public
key is not verified.

For remote delivery (federation): the pulled message's `senderPubKey` is stored
without any verification that it belongs to the claimed `senderAddress`.

#### 4. Message signatures — MISSING

Messages are encrypted but not signed. ECDH encryption proves the sender knows
their private key (since the shared secret requires it), but there's no explicit
signature that the recipient can verify. The recipient trusts that the server
stored the correct `senderPubKey`, but the server doesn't verify it (see #3).

#### 5. Federation content integrity — WEAK

When pulling a message from a remote server, the recipient verifies
`senderAddress` and `recipientAddress` match the notification, but does not
verify `senderPubKey`, `recipientPubKey`, or `encryptedContent`. A compromised
sender server could modify these fields.

#### 6. Other observations

- No CSRF token — relies solely on `sameSite: "lax"`.
- No rate limiting on failed logins beyond PoW (LOGIN_DIFFICULTY = 7M, ~1s on
  GPU).
- No forward secrecy — static ECDH keys mean a compromised private key exposes
  all past messages encrypted with that key pair.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Replace raw user ID cookies with hashed session tokens

#### Description

The session cookie currently stores a raw UUIDv7 user ID. Replace it with a
cryptographically random 32-byte token. The server stores only the BLAKE3 hash
of the token in a new `sessions` table. The raw token lives only in the cookie.

**Token lifecycle:**

- On login or account creation, generate 32 random bytes as hex (the token).
- BLAKE3 hash the token (single hash, no KDF — the token is already
  high-entropy, brute-force strengthening is pointless).
- Store `(tokenHash, userId, expiresAt, createdAt)` in the `sessions` table.
- Set the raw token as the cookie value.
- On every request: read cookie, hash it, look up the hash in `sessions`. If
  found and not expired, the user is authenticated. Otherwise, reject.
- On logout: delete the session row by hash, clear the cookie.
- On password change or key rotation: delete all session rows for the user
  except the current one (revoke all other sessions).

**Expiration policy:**

- Unsaved accounts: 1 day (same as now).
- Saved accounts: 30 days (reduced from 2 years).
- Lazy cleanup of expired rows on read (same pattern as `used_pow`).

#### Changes

**`webapp/src/db/schema.ts`** — Add `sessions` table:

```ts
export const sessions = mysqlTable("sessions", {
  tokenHash: varchar("token_hash", { length: 64 }).primaryKey(),
  userId: binaryId("user_id").notNull(),
  expiresAt: timestamp("expires_at").notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

**`webapp/src/server/user.server.ts`** — Add session functions:

- `createSession(userId, maxAge)` — generate random token, hash with BLAKE3,
  insert into `sessions`, return raw token.
- `resolveSession(token)` — hash token, look up in `sessions`, check expiry,
  lazy-delete expired rows, return `userId` or `null`.
- `deleteSession(token)` — hash token, delete from `sessions`.
- `deleteAllSessionsExcept(userId, currentTokenHash)` — revoke all other
  sessions for a user.
- `deleteAllSessions(userId)` — revoke all sessions (for account deletion).

**`webapp/src/server/user.functions.ts`** — Update all cookie operations:

- `createUser` — call `createSession(userId, ONE_DAY)`, set cookie to raw token.
- `getMyUser` / `getOrCreateUser` — replace `getUserById(getCookie())` with
  `resolveSession(getCookie())` to get the user ID.
- `saveMyUser` — after saving, create a new session with 30-day expiry
  (replacing the 1-day unsaved session).
- `login` — call `createSession(userId, THIRTY_DAYS)`, set cookie to raw token.
- `logout` — call `deleteSession(token)`, clear cookie.
- `deleteMyUser` — call `deleteAllSessions(userId)`, clear cookie.
- `changeMyPassword` — call `deleteAllSessionsExcept(userId, currentHash)` to
  revoke other sessions.

**`webapp/src/server/message.functions.ts`** — Update all `getCookie` call sites
to use `resolveSession` instead of treating the cookie value as a user ID.

Extract a shared helper (e.g. `getAuthenticatedUserId()`) that reads the cookie,
resolves the session, and throws "Not logged in" if invalid — replacing the
repeated pattern across both files.

**`webapp/src/server/pow.functions.ts`** — No changes (PoW doesn't touch
sessions).

#### Verification

1. Create an account — cookie value is a 64-char hex string (not a UUID).
2. `sessions` table has a row with a different hash, correct user ID, and expiry
   1 day from now.
3. Set password — session is replaced with a 30-day expiry.
4. Log out — session row is deleted, cookie is cleared.
5. Log in — new session row created with 30-day expiry.
6. Copy the cookie value, change password — old cookie no longer works (session
   revoked).
7. Directly querying the `sessions` table reveals only hashes, never raw tokens.
8. All existing functionality works: sending messages, key rotation, channel
   polling, federation.

**Result:** Pass

#### Conclusion

Session cookies now store a random 32-byte token. The database stores only the
BLAKE3 hash. Expiry reduced from 2 years to 30 days. Password changes revoke
all other sessions. The raw user ID is no longer exposed in cookies.

## Conclusion

The audit identified six findings. One was a real vulnerability (session
cookies), which is now fixed. The rest are either sound as-is, inherent to the
trust model, or acceptable tradeoffs.

### Finding status

**1. Session cookies — FIXED.** Raw UUIDv7 user IDs replaced with random
32-byte tokens. Database stores only BLAKE3 hashes. Expiry reduced to 30 days.
Password changes revoke all other sessions.

**2. Password hashing / KDF — No issue.** The three-tier BLAKE3 KDF is
well-designed. Password is never stored. Encryption key and login key are
siblings — neither derivable from the other. Server adds 100k additional rounds
before storing. 400k total rounds per guess.

**3. Sender public key verification — Not a vulnerability.** ECDH enforces
correctness: if the sender lies about their public key, the shared secret is
wrong and the recipient gets garbage. The sender has no incentive to send a
bogus key, and the cryptography makes it self-defeating.

**4. Message signatures — Not needed.** ECDH already provides authentication.
Only the holder of the correct private key can produce ciphertext that decrypts
with the expected shared secret. An explicit signature would be redundant.

**5. Federation content integrity — Inherent to federation.** The sender's
server is the authority for the sender's public key. A malicious server could
MITM its own users — this is true of any federated system (email, Matrix,
XMPP). Mitigations are social, not cryptographic: run your own server, trust
your operator, or verify keys out of band.

**6. Other observations — Acceptable.**
- CSRF: `sameSite: "lax"` + `httpOnly` cookies are adequate. All
  state-changing endpoints use POST.
- Rate limiting: PoW on every login makes brute-force computationally expensive
  by design. That is the purpose of PoW.
- Forward secrecy: static ECDH keys mean a compromised private key exposes past
  messages. Key rotation exists but does not re-encrypt old messages. Ephemeral
  keys (Double Ratchet) would add forward secrecy but are a major architectural
  change — a separate issue if ever pursued.
