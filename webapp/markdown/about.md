# About KeyPears

**Password manager for sovereign individuals**

KeyPears is a decentralized Diffie-Hellman key exchange platform that enables secure communication between any two email addresses (e.g., `alice@example.com` ↔ `bob@example2.com`). Built on this foundation, it serves as both a password manager and cryptocurrency wallet that puts you in complete control while making it easy to sync across devices and share with others.

## Our Mission

We believe that managing passwords and secrets should be:

- **Secure by default** - End-to-end encryption with strong cryptography
- **User-controlled** - You own your data, not a corporation
- **Easy to use** - Simple, intuitive interface across all platforms
- **Open and transparent** - Open-source software and protocols
