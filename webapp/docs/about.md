# About KeyPears

KeyPears is a new approach to password management that puts you in control of your secrets while making it easy to sync across devices and share with others.

## Our Mission

We believe that managing passwords and secrets should be:

- **Secure by default** - End-to-end encryption with strong cryptography
- **User-controlled** - You own your data, not a corporation
- **Easy to use** - Simple, intuitive interface across all platforms
- **Open and transparent** - Open-source software and protocols

## The KeyPears Approach

Unlike traditional password managers, KeyPears uses a decentralized architecture similar to email. You can:

- Run your own KeyPears node for complete self-custody
- Choose from multiple service providers
- Share secrets securely with end-to-end encryption
- Sync seamlessly across all your devices

## For Everyone

Whether you're a cryptocurrency enthusiast who needs secure wallet key management, a business team that needs to share credentials, or just someone who wants better control over their passwords, KeyPears is built for you.

## Open Source

KeyPears is open-source software licensed under Apache 2.0. We believe security tools should be transparent and auditable by the community.
